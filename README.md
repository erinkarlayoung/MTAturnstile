I code and develop apps to solve problems. To me, what was missing from a lot of the popular MTA/public transit apps was the intangibles that might make you change your travel plans. Is a station unsafe? You might not go there alone late at night. Do you have to walk a mile underground to make that transfer? you might choose flats instead of heels. 

Turnstile is an app that combines the map functionality of a standard MTA/Public transit app with a Yelp-style review system to allow users to give feedback on station safety, cleanliness, etc. It is a fun user interface that displays all pertinent information on a single page without the need for web redirects, idea for use in areads with poor wireless or cellular signal.
